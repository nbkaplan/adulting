# Abstract
It's become evident that there is a lack of knowledge on the proper way to open and store seltzer cans. While I applaud the effort of every team member who pitches in to keep the supply of cold carbonated concoctions conveniently available, improper technique often leads to wasted space, inaccessible cans, and reduces the overall convenience for everyone. 
The purpose of this RFC is to standardize the way we open and store seltzer in the fridge.

## How to Resolve
 
1.  Remove the boxes from the shipping material:

2.  Identify perforated opening on the end:

3.	Open along perforation. Note that the flaps themselves remain attached to the box:

4.  Place the box in the fridge upright, with the open section down and forward:

	In this fashion, all cans in the case can be easily accessed, with a minimal footprint on the shelf.

For boxes that have been too badly damaged from improper use, transition the contents to one of the lower drawers.
 
## Alternate Configurations
 
Smaller boxes have similar perforations to assist you in intelligent storage.
 
1.  Locate perforations:

2.  Remove cardboard opening. Note that unlike the previous example, the perforated section is completely separated:

3.  Now you can place both varieties side by side and 100% accessible, in the same space that was previously taken by one variety at 30% accessibility:

# Summary
If you are unable or unwilling to adhere to these methods, please refrain from putting soda cases in the fridge. If there are any questions or concerns about the steps laid out above, please contact myself or another adult.
